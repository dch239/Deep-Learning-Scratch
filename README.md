# Neural Networks from scratch
Implemented Deep Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network using numpy as a part of homework assignment. Credits to course producers of CSCI 566: Deep Learning and its Applications.
### Deep Neural Network
Please find the notebook Neural_Network.ipynb to find the implementation of a basic multi-layer fully connected neural network from scratch, including forward and backward passes of certain essential layers, to perform an image classification task on the CIFAR100 dataset. Implemented essential functions in different indicated python files under directory `lib/mlp`.
## Convolutional Neural Network
Please find the notebook Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb to find the implementation of a basic CNN from scratch Implemented essential functions in different indicated python files under directory `lib/cnn`.
